# prime-factorization

The simplest method of finding factors is so-called **direct search factorization** (a.k.a. trial division). In this method, all possible factors are systematically tested using trial division to see if they actually divide the given number. It is practical only for very small numbers.

The fastest-known fully proven deterministic algorithm is the **Pollard-Strassen method** (Pomerance 1982; Hardy et al. 1990).
